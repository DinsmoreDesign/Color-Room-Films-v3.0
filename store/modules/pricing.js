                `Our most popular package with couples needing all day coverage. 10 hour-2 shooter coverage. Drone is included weather pending. This package works great for couples that want everything captured and usually gets us close to the end of the night! You will receive a trailer and full film (full film lengths can vary), we never put a limit on the length of your full film either! Couples receive all dance floor footage in it's entirety along with all the days major events. Delivery is via Vimeo in 4K resolution. We also NEVER USE LIGHTS! This helps us achieve the best ambience when it comes to candid dancefloor footage!`

                `This package works great for couples who only need 8 hours and one shooter with only a couple locations. We shoot this package in 4K and deliver is the same as our other packages. Normally drone is not including in single shooter packages. We shoot this package mainly for the full film and put together a complimentary recap for you also. This is part of our associate program and generally Steve will not shoot these but does on occasion.`
