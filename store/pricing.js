This package works great for couples that want everything captured and usually gets us close to the end of the night! You will receive a trailer and full film (full film lengths can vary), we never put a limit on the length of your full film either! Couples receive all dance floor footage in it's entirety along with all the days major events. Delivery is via Vimeo in 4K resolution. We also NEVER USE LIGHTS! This helps us achieve the best ambience when it comes to candid dancefloor footage!`
